TODO:
=====

* Add a delete to ObjectIdFileLoader.
* Add checksum checking for integrity.
* Add encription for more confidentiality (especially when transmitting the fragments).
* Sync database and remote cloud repos to delete orphaned fragments.
* Use FragmentRepositories in a least-used basis.
* Refactor and optimize the JLan code.
* Add versioning if possible (need to investigate on this).
