TODO:
=====

* Add a delete to ObjectIdFileLoader.
* Use FragmentRepositories in a least-used basis.
* Test if it's more efficient in terms of memory to save/load fragments from the temp files.
* Sync database and remote cloud repos to delete orphaned fragments.
* Add checksum checking.
* Add versioning (need to investigate on this).
