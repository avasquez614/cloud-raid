TODO:
=====

* Check if there's a way to tell JLan to not close NFS when downloading big file. Maybe break files in chunks?
* Add checksum checking for integrity.
* Add a delete to ObjectIdFileLoader.
* Sync database and remote cloud repos to delete orphaned fragments.
* Use FragmentRepositories in a least-used basis.
* Refactor and optimize the JLan code.
* Try to test other IDAs.
* Add versioning if possible (need to investigate on this).
